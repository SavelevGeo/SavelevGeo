Personal statement

Motivated and experienced GIS professional with technical knowledge in
ESRI ArcGIS and QGIS. Specializing in the development of web GIS
solutions for geological projects, I am a Database Specialist skilled in
collecting and analyzing geospatial data using advanced Geographic
Information Systems (GIS) techniques.

I optimize the process by scripting in Python/VBA and running SQL
queries for data tracking and geographic data manipulation. With five
years of experience in the field, I have successfully completed numerous
projects and delivered high-quality results, integrating GIS into
geology.
